## Release 1.0.1 (May 8, 2021)

There are no code changes in this release, though Java 8 is now the bytecode target due to requirements imposed by recent versions of Gradle.  This project previously targeted Java 6.

The build script has been updated to be compatible with Gradle 7.0 and the latest version of [BuildScripts](https://github.com/kloverde/BuildScripts).

Beginning with this release, releases will be source only.  Binary builds will no longer be provided.
