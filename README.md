NumberUtil
==========

See LICENSE for this software's licensing terms.

This project is named NumberUtil in case I broaden its scope in the future, but for now it only applies to BigDecimal.

I don't like using BigDecimal.compareTo, so I created public static methods for the boolean comparison operators.


# Setup

1. Get BuildScripts from https://github.com/kloverde/BuildScripts
2. If you use Eclipse, install Buildship if you don't already have it
3. Update `buildScriptsDir` in gradle.properties to reflect the path where you put BuildScripts

...or just do your own thing because this project is so simple ;)
